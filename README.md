# Recognizing the existence of ghost lineages reverses the results of evolutionary studies on genetic transfers

## Description
This repository contains the data and code associated with the manuscript entitled: "Ghost lineages invalidate or reverse several results on gene flow" by T Tricou, E Tannier and DM de Vienne.


* The folder `D3` contains script and datasets used for analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the D3 statistics interpretation (Hahn and Hibbins 2019).

* The folder `Anopheles` contains scripts and datasets used for analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the methd that uses branch lengths in gene trees to find the "true" species branching order (Fontaine et al. 2015).

* The folder `Stem-length` contains the scripts used to generate the dataset that allowed exploring the effect of ghost lineages on the use of the stem-length method to relatively time successive acquisition events (Pittis and Gabaldon, 2016).
