# Recognizing the existence of ghost lineages reverses the results of evolutionary studies on genetic transfers

This repository contains the data and code associated with the manuscript entitled: "Ghost lineages invalidate or reverse several results on gene flows" by T Tricou, E Tannier and DM de Vienne.


* The folder `D3` contains script and datasets used for analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the D3 statistics interpretation

* The folder `Anopheles` contains script and datasets used for the analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the use of branch length in gene trees to find the "true" species branching order (as in Fontaine et al. 2015)

* The folder `Stem-length` contains the script used to generate the dataset that allowed exploring the effect of ghost lineages on the use of stem-length to relatively time successive acquisition events (as in Pittis and Gabaldon, 2016).
