# Code and data that accompany the manuscript _Ghost lineages invalidate or reverse several results on gene flow_ by T. Tricou, E. Tannier and D. M. de Vienne

## Description
This repository contains the data and code associated with the manuscript cited above. It is composed of three folders for the three studies re-examined, in our study, in the light of ghost lineages. In each folder, details on how the scripts are organised is given in a `README` file. 


* The folder `D3` contains script and datasets used for analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the D3 statistics interpretation (Hahn and Hibbins 2019).

* The folder `Anopheles` contains scripts and datasets used for analyzing the effect of ghost lineages on the methd that uses branch lengths in gene trees to find the "true" species branching order (Fontaine et al. 2015).

* The folder `Stem-length` contains the scripts used to generate the dataset that allowed exploring the effect of ghost lineages on the use of the stem-length method to relatively time successive acquisition events (Pittis and Gabaldon, 2016).
